# AI in Customer Service

Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary of my project

My dream is to implement as much of the elements of AI as possible to automatize and speed up all centralized customer service functions.
NLP combined with a bot could without difficulties handle majority of the customer contacts, such as messages, chats and even some of the calls. 
I firmly believe that automation combined with AI is the future solution of handling customer service centres. 
What should be developed more, is the tone of voice and quality of the the AI answers for customers, but I see it just as a matter of will, more than a real problem.



## Background

Having AI working in these functions would significantly reduce costs and assure 100% percent and fast answers to customers.

* problem 1: The volume of customer messages is increasing in all digital channels. using only people as workforce is non cost-effective and too slow
* problem 2: People want fist time resolutions through digital channels, and more and more without human contact

## How is it used?
AI in my project would be used in the background labeling messages and answering them without human interference. There should of course be persons monitoring the AI functions all the time and teaching it. I would love to see it formulating good enough answers and solutions that would leave the humans in customer service operations only handling more complicated and advanced detailed questions and inquiries.

## Challenges

The capability of the present day NLP and the language used by the AI bots still need some development. AI should be tought more of tone of voice and to tarck customer emotions. Another thing is foreseeing what the customers want. Is it automation and speed, or personal service? One cannot be exactly sure, but if we take a look on the younger generations, almost no one uses the mobile phone to speak! All functions are handled by chats and bots. That to me at least is very revealing of the future.

## What next?

I should have a great sparring partner in an AI offering corporation to have ideas how to make my dream reality. Small POCÂ´s could be tested and would be very usefull.
Concrete next step that I am working on is a chatbot with NLP qualifications. It should be implemented in my branch of business in the 1st quarter of 2021. Looking really much forward to that!
