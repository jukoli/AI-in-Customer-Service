# AI in Customer Service

Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary

My dream is to implement as much of the elements of AI as possible to automatize and speed up all centralized customer service functions.
NLP combined with a bot could without difficulties handle majority of the customer contacts, such as messages, chats and even some of the calls. 
I firmly believe that automation combined with AI is the future solution of handling customer service centres. 
What should be developed more, is the tone of voice and quality of the the AI answers for customers, but I see it just as a matter of will, more than a real problem.

## Background

Having AI working in these functions would significantly reduce costs and assure 100% percent and fast answers to customers.

* problem 1: The volume of customer messages is increasing in all digital channels. using only people as workforce is non cost-effective and too slow
* problem 2: People want fist time resolutions through digital channels, and more and more without human contact

## How is it used?
AI in my project would be used in the background labeling messages and answering them without human interference. There should of course be persons monitoring the AI functions all the time and teaching it. I would love to see it formulating good enough answers and solutions that would leave the humans in customer service operations only handling more complicated and advanced detailed questions and inquiries.

This is how you create code examples:
```
def main():
   countries = ['Denmark', 'Finland', 'Iceland', 'Norway', 'Sweden']
   pop = [5615000, 5439000, 324000, 5080000, 9609000]   # not actually needed in this exercise...
   fishers = [1891, 2652, 3800, 11611, 1757]

   totPop = sum(pop)
   totFish = sum(fishers)

   # write your solution here

   for i in range(len(countries)):
      print("%s %.2f%%" % (countries[i], 100.0))    # current just prints 100%

main()
```


## Data sources and AI methods
Where does your data come from? Do you collect it yourself or do you use data collected by someone else?
If you need to use links, here's an example:
[Twitter API](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs)

| Syntax      | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Header      | Title       |
| Paragraph   | Text        |

## Challenges

What does your project _not_ solve? Which limitations and ethical considerations should be taken into account when deploying a solution like this?

## What next?

How could your project grow and become something even more? What kind of skills, what kind of assistance would you  need to move on?
